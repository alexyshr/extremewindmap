preface: |
  Models of extreme values are used for designing against the effects of extreme events like earthquakes, winds, rainfall, floods of different types of physical processes, avoiding widespread destruction and loss of lives. This research presents a applied case of univariate extreme value analysis applied to wind velocities for infrastructure design, consequently, the main interest are probable future more extreme wind events that structures need to be able to resist. 
  
  This work in its theoretical and methodological component was directed by ASCE7-16 @Asce2017 considering that output products will be used to update the chapter B.6, wind forces, of the Colombian earthquake resistant standard - NSR-10, maintained by the Colombian Association of Seismic Engineering - AIS by its Spanish acronym. ASCE7-16, defines four risk categories, which implies the use of different wind loads (represented in wind extreme values for different mean recurrence intervals) for structures that belong to each category, 3000 years of MRI for risk IV, 1700 years for risk III, and 700 years for risk II and I. 
  
  This research has a particularly new situation regarding to the input data, and it is that not only time series of field measurements from meteorological stations are used (IDEAM data source), but also post-processed information coming from the Integrated Surface Database - ISD (USA database based on IDEAM data source), and forecast reanalysis data from ERA5. This condition demanded a comparison of the different data sources in order to verify the feasibility of using ERA5 and ISD, with a previous process of standardization of wind velocities to reach the needed requirement of 3-s wind gust speed, 10 meters anemometers high and open space condition. 
  
  At each station the used method Peaks Over Threshold - Poisson Process, required to identify all the non-thunderstorm events in the non-hurricane dataset through a process of de-clustering, choose a suitable threshold level to leave for the analysis only the most extreme  values available, and then fit to the data a Gumbel extreme value distribution using maximum likelihood to find optimal parameters with the best goodness of fit. With the fitted model, it was possible to calculate return levels for required mean return intervals. Next, a process of spatial interpolation was done using Kriging, what allowed to have three continuous maps for the whole study area. Main interest writing this document, is help to readers to enter speedily with the current details around wind extreme analysis.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}


This research aims to create non-hurricane non-tornadic maps of extreme wind speeds for _three specific recurrence intervals_ (700, 1700, and 3000 years) covering the Colombian territory. These maps will be combined with existing hurricane wind speed studies, to be used as input loads due to wind for infrastructure design.

For each station with wind speeds time histories in the input data, extreme wind speed corresponding to each recurrence interval are calculated using a _Peaks Over Threshold_ onwards _POT_ extreme value model, then wind velocities with the same recurrence interval are _spatially interpolated_ to generate continuous maps for the whole study area.

A wind speed linked to a _mean recurrence interval - MRI_ of _N-years_ (N-years return value or return period) is interpreted as the highest probable wind speed along the period of N-years. The annual probability of equal or exceed that wind speed is 1/N. The annual exceedance probability for all velocity values in 700-years output map will be 1/700, for the 1700-years map will be 1/1700, and 1/3000 for the 3000-years final map.

There are different methods to model extreme value data, among them are a) sample maxima using a _Generalized Extreme Value Distribution_ onwards _GEVD_ (traditional method), b) POT using a _Generalized Pareto Distribution_ onwards _GPD_, c) POT using a two-dimensional Poisson Process, that can be homogeneous, non-homogeneous, stationary, and non-stationary (originally know as _Point Process_ approach), and d) POT Poisson-GPD. Following @Pintar2015 in this research a _POT using a non-homogeneous non-stationary two-dimensional Poisson proces_ was selected, despite there is no R package available to apply this approach. 

## Background

To design one structure, the horizontal forces wind and earthquake play an starring role. For the study area, Colombia, initially the wind force was considered with the decree 1984 as a fixed velocity $100  \frac{Km}{h}$, later a continuous map with a return period of 50 years was included in the official design standard of the time (NSR-98), then, with the update to NSR-10, an additional map with return period of 700 yeas was included.

In the context of this study, extreme wind analysis is concerned with statistical methods applied to very high values of wind as random variable in a stochastic process, to allow statistical inference from historical data, namely, assess from the ordered sample of wind velocities, the probability of wind events that are more extreme than the ones previously observed and included in the mentioned input sample. Classical reference in this matter is @Coles2001, where a detailed study is done about classical extreme value theory and models and threshold models. There are four main approaches to deal with extreme value analysis: - sample maxima associated to a Generalized Extreme Value Distribution - GEV, - exceedances over threshold associated to a Generalized Pareto Distribution - GPD, - the Poisson-GPD, an homogeneous Poisson process for the number of exceedances and a GPD for the excess values, and the exceedances over threshold associated to a non- homogeneous bi-dimensional Poisson process, a Point process approach also known as Peaks Over Threshold - POT - Poisson process. Main details will be discussed here for each method, but as the last one is recommended in Asce2017, a more indeed explanation will be provided in for [POT-Poisson Process](#pot-pp).

### Sample maxima

To work with random variables of sample maximum values, the used probability distribution function _pdf_ is the GEV

$$
H(y) = \exp\left\{-\left(1+\xi\frac{y-\mu}{\psi}\right)_+^{-\frac{1}{\xi}}\right\},
$$
$(y+=max(y,0))$ where $\mu$ is the location parameter, $\psi > 0$ is a scale parameter, and $\xi$ is a shape parameter. GEV can be seen as the integration in the same _psf_ of the Gumbel distribution (limit $\xi\rightarrow0$), Fréchet distribution ($\xi>0$), and Weibull distribution ($\xi<0$).

### Exceedances over threshold

If the researcher needs to work only with extreme values above an specific threshold, @Pickands1971 showed that the GEV has a GPD approximation where shape $\xi$ parameter in previous equation is the same parameter for next equation for GPD,

$$
G(y,\sigma, \xi) = 1-\left(1+\xi\frac{y}{\sigma}\right)_+^{-\frac{1}{\xi}},
$$
### Poisson-GPD
If a rescale of the variable indexes above the threshold is performed, then the exceedances over threshold approach can be seen as a point process, namely, an homogeneous Poisson Process where:

1. The number of exceedances above the threshold has a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda$
2. The excess values follow a GPD with $N\leq1$

Its cumulative distribution function _cdf_ is

$$
F(y) = \exp\left\{-\lambda\left(1+\xi\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma}\right)_+^{-\frac{1}{\xi}}\right\},
$$

## Research Aim and Objectives

Main aim of this research is the estimation of wind extreme velocities to be used as input loads for the design of different types of structures, considering its risk categories, and covering any place in the whole study area.

Specific objectives are:

1. Analyze and compare three different sources of historical wind time series, to select and use the best data source (or combination or sources) for research, based on objective criteria, for instance similitude, completeness, coverage, etcetera, to achieve this way a formal support for the decision made in this regard.

2. Select and apply an suitable extreme value analysis method that allows to fulfill wind load requirements defined for the respective authority in the study area

3. Estimate extreme wind values for the stations in the selected input data source, for three MRI (700, 1700, 3000 years), considering non-hurricane studies.

4. Generate continuous maps for MRIs 700, 1700, and 3000 years, using the most suitable spatial interpolation technique, considering the specific characteristics of the input data and advantages and disadvantages of the selected methods

5. Combine output maps from non-hurricane analysis, with existing hurricane studies to allow the inclusion of the research study in the NSR-10 norm.

## Research Question

Main question of this research is directed to calculate future extreme velocities (return levels) for infrastructure design, then the research question could be

**What extreme velocities (return levels) need to be used as load design forces for structures of different use category, in the study area?**

If we remember that, for the case study area (Colombia), there are predefined requirements or mean return intervals - MRI  to design structures depending of it use category, and that this MRI values are 700, 1700, and 3000 years, the research question could be more specific.

**What extreme velocities (return levels) will be equaled or exceeded with a probability equal to $\frac{1}{MRI}$ in a given year?**

**What extreme velocities (return levels) will be equaled or exceeded only one time in the period defined for this specific MRIs: 700, 1700, and 3000 years?**

If we consider not only the annual exceedance probability $\frac{1}{MRI}$, but also the exposure time (compound probability), understood as the time the structure will be in use, then the question will be

**What extreme velocities (return levels) will have a occurrence compound probability of 67%, when the exposure time of the structure will be equal to the main return intervals 700, 1700, and 3000 years?**
