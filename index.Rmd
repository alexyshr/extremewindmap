Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence (add #) them. 

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

<!-- On ordering the chapter files:
There are two options:
1. Name your chapter files in the order in which you want them to appear (e.g., 01-Inro, 02-Data, 03-Conclusions). 
2. Otherwise, you can specify the order in which they appear in the _bookdown.yml (for PDF only).

Do not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd and 00-abstract.Rmd in the YAML file--they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This research aims to create non-hurricane non-tornadic maps of extreme wind speeds for _three specific recurrence intervals_ (700, 1700, and 3000 years) covering the Colombian territory. These maps will be combined with existing hurricane wind speed studies, to be used as input loads due to wind for infrastructure desing.

For each station with wind speeds time histories in the input data, extreme wind speed corresponding to each recurrence interval are calculated using a _Peaks Over Threshold_ onwards _POT_ extreme value model, then wind velocities with the same recurrence interval are _spatially interpolated_ to generate continuous maps for the whole study area.

A wind speed linked to a _mean recurrence interval - MRI_ of _N-years_ (N-years return value or return period) is interpreted as the highest probable wind speed along the period of N-years. The annual probability of equal or exceed that wind speed is 1/N. The annual excedance probability for all velocity values in 700-years output map will be 1/700, for the 1700-years map will be 1/1700, and 1/3000 for the 3000-years final map.

There are different methods to model extreme value data, among them are a) sample maxima using a _Generalized Extreme Value Distribution_ onwards _GEVD_ (traditional method), b) POT using a _Generalized Pareto Distribution_ onwards _GPD_, c) POT using a two-dimensional Poisson Process, that can be homomegenos, non-homogeneous, stationary, and non-stationary (originally know as _Point Process_ approach), and d) POT Poisson-GPD. Following @Pintar2015 in this research a _POT using a non-homogeneous non-stationary two-dimensional poisson proces_ was selected, despide there is no R package available to apply this approach.
