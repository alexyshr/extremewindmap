  Models of extreme values are used for designing against the effects of extreme events like earthquakes, winds, rainfall, floods of different types of physical processes, avoiding widespread destruction and loss of lifes. This research presents a applied case of univariate extreme value analysis applied to wind velocities for infrastructure desing, consequently, the main interest are probabile future extreme wind events that structures need to be able to resist. This work in its teorethical and methodological component was directed by ASCE7-16 @Asce2017 considering that output products will be used to update the chapter B.6, wind forces, of the Colombian earthquake resistant standard - NSR-10, maintaided by the Colombian Association of Seismic Engineering - AIS by its spahish acronym. ASCE7-16, defines four risk categories, which implies the use of different wind loads (represented in wind extreme values for different mean recurrence intervals) for structures that belong to each category, 3000 years of MRI for risk IV, 1700 years for risk III, and 700 years for risk II and I. This research has a particularly new situation regarding to the input data, and it is that not only time series of field measurements from meteorological stations are used (IDEAM data source), but also post-procesed information comming from the Integrated Surface Database - ISD (USA database based on IDEAM data source), and forecast reanalysis data from ERA5. This condition demanded a comparison of the different data sources in order to verify the feasibility of using ERA5 and ISD, with a previous activitie of sdandarization of wind velocities to reach the needed requirement of 3-s wind gust speed, 10 meters anemometers high and open space condition. At each station the used method Peaks Over Threshold - Poisson Process, required to identfy all the non-thunderstorm events in the non-hurricane dataset through a process of declustering, choose a suitable threshold level to leave for the analysis only the most extreme availables values, and then fit to the data a Gumbel extreme value distributon using maximun likelihood to find optimal parameters with the best goodness of fit. With the fitted model, it was possible to calculate return levels for required mean return intervals. Next, a process of spatial interpolation was done using Kriging, what allowed to have three continuous maps for the whole study area. Main interest writing this document, is help to readers to enter speedelly with the current details around wind extreme analysis.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This research aims to create non-hurricane non-tornadic maps of extreme wind speeds for _three specific recurrence intervals_ (700, 1700, and 3000 years) covering the Colombian territory. These maps will be combined with existing hurricane wind speed studies, to be used as input loads due to wind for infrastructure desing.

For each station with wind speeds time histories in the input data, extreme wind speed corresponding to each recurrence interval are calculated using a _Peaks Over Threshold_ onwards _POT_ extreme value model, then wind velocities with the same recurrence interval are _spatially interpolated_ to generate continuous maps for the whole study area.

A wind speed linked to a _mean recurrence interval - MRI_ of _N-years_ (N-years return value or return period) is interpreted as the highest probable wind speed along the period of N-years. The annual probability of equal or exceed that wind speed is 1/N. The annual excedance probability for all velocity values in 700-years output map will be 1/700, for the 1700-years map will be 1/1700, and 1/3000 for the 3000-years final map.

There are different methods to model extreme value data, among them are a) sample maxima using a _Generalized Extreme Value Distribution_ onwards _GEVD_ (traditional method), b) POT using a _Generalized Pareto Distribution_ onwards _GPD_, c) POT using a two-dimensional Poisson Process, that can be homomegenos, non-homogeneous, stationary, and non-stationary (originally know as _Point Process_ approach), and d) POT Poisson-GPD. Following @Pintar2015 in this research a _POT using a non-homogeneous non-stationary two-dimensional poisson proces_ was selected, despide there is no R package available to apply this approach. 

## Background

To desing one structure, the horizontal forces wind and earthquake play an starring role. For the study area, Colombia, initially the wind force was considered with the decree 1984 as a fixed velocity $100  \frac{Km}{h}$, later a continuos map with a return period of 50 years was included in the official design standard of the time (NSR-98), then, with the update to NSR-10, an additional map with return period of 700 yeas was included.

Extreme wind analysis is concerned with statistical methods applied to very high values of wind as random variable in a stochastic process, to allow statistical inference from historical data. Classical reference in this matter is @Coles2001, where a detailed study is done about classical extreme value theory and models and threshold models. There are four main approaches to deal with extreme value analysis: - sample maxima associated to a Generalized Extreme Value Distribution - GEV, - excedances over threshold associated to a Generalized Paretto Distribution - GPD, - the Poisson-GPD, an homogeneous Poisson process fot the number of excedancess and a GPD fot the excess values, and the exceedances over threshold associated to a non- homomeneous bi-dimensional Poisson process, a Point process approach also known as Peaks Over Threshold - POT - Poisson process. Main details will be disscused here for each method, but as the last one is recommended in Asce2017, a more indeep explanation will be provided in for [POT-Poisson Process](#pot-pp).

### Sample maxima

To work with random variables of sample maximun values, the used probability distribution function _pdf_ is the GEV

$$
H(y) = \exp\left\{-\left(1+\xi\frac{y-\mu}{\psi}\right)_+^{-\frac{1}{\xi}}\right\},
$$
$(y+=max(y,0))$ where $\mu$ is the location parameter, $\psi > 0$ is a scale parameter, and $\xi$ is a shape parameter. GEV can be seen as the integration in the same _psf_ of the Gumbel distribution (limit $\xi\rightarrow0$), Fréchet distribution ($\xi>0$), and Weibull distribution ($\xi<0$).

### Exceedances over threshold

If the researcher needs to work only with extreme values above an specific threshold, @Pickands1971 showed that the GEV has a GPD approximation where shape $\xi$ parameter in previous equation is the same parameter for next equation for GPD,

$$
G(y,\sigma, \xi) = 1-\left(1+\xi\frac{y}{\sigma}\right)_+^{-\frac{1}{\xi}},
$$
### Poisson-GPD
If a rescale of the variable indices above the threshold is performed, then the exceedances over threshold approach can be seen as a point process, namely, an homogeneous Poisson Process where:

1. The number of exceedances above the threshold has a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda$
2. The excees values follow a GPD with $N\leq1$

Its cumulative distribution function _cdf_ is

$$
F(y) = \exp\left\{-\lambda\left(1+\xi\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma}\right)_+^{-\frac{1}{\xi}}\right\},
$$
