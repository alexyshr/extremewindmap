# Methodology {#rmd-method}

Figure \@ref(fig:methodology) shows a graphic representation of the methodology. This thesis research is focus in non-hurricane data, with three main elements: - data, - temporal analysis with a POT- Poisson process, and - spatial analysis with probabilistic and deterministic methods to do spatial interpolation and create return levels (wind velocities) maps, for MRI of 700, 1700, and 3000 years. An additional element, is the integration with existing hurricane maps to produce final maps, that will be used as input loads for infrastructure design, and will be part of the NSR-10.

More representative and important steps of the methodology are identified by numbers, 1) standardization, 2) de-clustering, 3) thresholding, 4) fit intensity function, 5) hazard curve, 6) return levels, and 7) spatial interpolation. Steps 1 to 6, need to be done for each available station to get MRI wind velocities. With MRI wind velocities in each station, a continuous surface will be created, one for 700 years, next for 1700 years and finally 3000 years. Figure \@ref(fig:mainmethodology) schematize that iterative process.

## Data

### Getting the data

### Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA

### Standardization

#### Anemometer height - 10 m

According to the protocol for field data collection and location of methodological stations - @ideam2005, the anemometer (wind sensor) in installed always to a fixed high of 10 meters from the surface, as is shown in figure \@ref(fig:anemometer), ergo, no height correction.

include_graphics(path = "figure/anemometer.png")
```


#### Surface Roughness - 0.03 m
Due to the effects that the terrain has on wind speed, a correction should be applied if the station is located in a geographical space considered "no open terrain". When terrain is open, the roughness corresponds to 0.03 meters. There are some alternative methodologies to calculate the roughness, @Masters2010 uses the station data, but the separation of the measurements should not exceed one minute, something difficult to obtain, and @Lettau1969 uses an empirical equation that is recommended in @Asce2017 (page 743, equation C26.7-1), which was used here,

$$
Roughness = z_0= 0.5 * H_{ob}*\frac{S_{ob}}{A_{ob}}
$$
Where $H_{ob}$ is the average height of the obstacles, $S_{ob}$ is the average vertical area perpendicular to the wind of the obstacle, and $A_{ob}$ is the average area of the terrain occupied by each obstruction. Then the empirical exponent $\alpha$, gradient height $z_g$, and exposure coefficient $K_z$, corresponding to equations C26.10-3, C26.10-4, and C26.10-1.si of @Asce2017, are used to calculate the correction factor $F_{exposition}$, verifying that $z_0$ units are in meters.

$$
\alpha =  5.65*z_0^{-0.133}
$$

$$
z_g=450*z_0^{0.125}
$$

$$
K_z= 2.01*\left(\frac{z}{z_g}\right)
$$

$$
F_{exposition} = \frac{0.951434}{K_z}
$$


#### Averaging Time - 3-s gust

To transform hourly mean wind velocity $V_{3600}$ to 3-s gust velocity $V_3$, @Asce2017 recommends to use @Durst1960. See [Wind Loads Requirements](#windloadsrequirements). As the axis $x$ represents duration $t$ of the gust, what is done is to look there for the value 3 seconds, and read the corresponding gust factor $\frac{V_t}{V_{3600}}$, this is, the value in the axis $y$, then

$$
V_t = V_{3\,seconds} = (gust factor) * V_{3600\,seconds}
$$

It is valid only for open terrain conditions. Durst curve shows in axis $y$ the gust factor $\frac{V_t}{V_{3600}}$, a ration between any wind gust averaged at $t$ seconds, $V_t$, and the hourly averaged wind speed $V_{3600}$, and in the axis $x$ the duration $t$ of the gust.


### Filtering 

### Separating 

### Comparison

### Selection of input data


## POT - Poisson Process

### De-clustering

### Exclude no-data periods

### Thresholding

As the POT model requires to work only with the most extreme values in the time series, it is necessary to select a threshold to filter out small values. Selection of threshold value imply two effects in the model. Bias is high when a low threshold is selected (many exceedances) because the asymptotic support is weak. Opposite situation happens for high thresholds where variance is potentially high, so according to Davidson and Smith 1990 (XXX), it is needed to select a threshold value, consistent with model structure.
