# Methodology {#rmd-method}

Figure \@ref(fig:methodology) shows a graphic representation of the methodology. This research is focus in non-hurricane data, with three main elements: - data, - temporal analysis with a POT-PP, and - spatial analysis with probabilistic and deterministic methods to do spatial interpolation and create return levels (wind velocities) maps, for MRI of 700, 1700, and 3000 years. An additional element, is the integration with existing hurricane maps to produce final maps, that will be used as input loads for infrastructure design, and will be part of the design standard.

More representative and important steps of the methodology are identified by numbers in figure \@ref(fig:methodology), 1) standardization, 2) de-clustering, 3) thresholding, 4) fit intensity function, 5) hazard curve, 6) return levels, and 7) spatial interpolation. Steps 1 to 6, need to be done for each available station to get extreme wind velocities (return levels - RL) for MRI. With RL in each station, a continuous surface will be created, one for 700 years, next for 1700 years and finally for 3000 years. Figure \@ref(fig:mainmethodology) schematize the iterative process in the methodology.

## Data Standardization {#rmd-standartization}

Parallel to the standardization activity described below (3-s gust, roughness, and 10 meters anemometer height), it is also important to consider for all stations involved in the analysis:

* _Separating_: As far as possible, identify each record of the time series, as thunderstorm (t) or non-thunderstorm (nt)

* _Filtering_: Remove wind speeds above $200 \frac{Km}{h}$ and data pertaining to hurricane events, because the procedure with hurricane requires a different approach and need to be done independently

* Downscaling approach: As it happens in this study, where it is intended to complement the local/regional wind analysis, with data from ISD (output data of a model for extreme winds), and ERA5 reanalysis dataset (large scale forecast data), it is required to probe by means of _comparisons_ (exploratory data analysis and statistical measures) that modeled or forecast data are suitable to complement the study.

### Anemometer height - 10 m

According to the protocol for field data collection and location of methodological stations - @ideam2005, the anemometer (wind sensor) in installed always to a fixed height of 10 meters from the surface, as is shown in figure \@ref(fig:anemometer), ergo, no height correction is needed.

### Surface Roughness at Open Terrain (0.03 m) {#rmd-roughness}

Due to the effects that the terrain has on wind speed, a correction should be applied if the station is located in a geographical space considered "not open terrain". When terrain is open, the roughness corresponds to 0.03 meters. There are some alternative methodologies to calculate the roughness, @Masters2010 uses the station data, but the separation of the measurements should not exceed one minute, something difficult to obtain, and @Lettau1969 uses an empirical equation that is recommended in @Asce2017 (page 743, equation C26.7-1), which was used here,

$$
Roughness = z_0= 0.5 * H_{ob}*\frac{S_{ob}}{A_{ob}}
$$
Where $H_{ob}$ is the average height of the obstacles, $S_{ob}$ is the average vertical area perpendicular to the wind of the obstacles, and $A_{ob}$ is the average area of the terrain occupied by each obstruction. Then, the empirical exponent $\alpha$, gradient height $z_g$, and exposure coefficient $K_z$, corresponding to equations C26.10-3, C26.10-4, and C26.10-1.si of @Asce2017, are used to calculate the correction factor $F_{exposition}$, verifying that $z_0$ units are in meters.

$$
\alpha =  5.65*z_0^{-0.133}
$$

$$
z_g=450*z_0^{0.125}
$$

$$
K_z= 2.01*\left(\frac{z}{z_g}\right)
$$

$$
F_{exposition} = \frac{0.951434}{K_z}
$$
Following @nist2012, calculation of roughness need to be weighted according to the predominance of wind magnitude in eight directions (north, south, east, west, north-east, north-west, south-east, and south-west), see  figure \@ref(fig:compassrose), using a detailed aerial photo or satellite image inside a radiuos of 800 meters around the station location, as shown in figure \@ref(fig:lettaustation), with south direction highlighted.

Figure \@ref(fig:lettauexamples) shows extreme conditions for roughness, open space in left image (ISD Station 804070), closed space in center image (ISD Station 803000), and a typical example where Lettau procedure is needed. Lettau equation need to be applied to each direction and then the final $z_o$ value is the weighted average, using historical wind percentage. See figure \@ref(fig:lettauvalues) showing the strokes made to calculate the different areas for two Colombian stations. Information about wind percentage per direction at each station were obtained from @ideam1999.

### Averaging Time 3-s Gust {#rmd-gust}

To transform hourly mean wind velocity $V_{3600}$, to 3-s gust velocity $V_3$, @Asce2017 recommends to use @Durst1960. See [Wind Loads Requirements](#windloadsrequirements). As the axis $x$ represents duration $t$ of the gust, what is done is to look there for the value 3 seconds, and read the corresponding gust factor $\frac{V_t}{V_{3600}}$, this is, the value in the axis $y$, then

$$
V_t = V_{3\,seconds} = (gust factor) * V_{3600\,seconds}
$$

It is valid only for open terrain conditions. Durst curve shows in axis $y$ the gust factor $\frac{V_t}{V_{3600}}$, a ration between any wind gust averaged at $t$ seconds, $V_t$, and the hourly averaged wind speed $V_{3600}$, and in the axis $x$ the duration $t$ of the gust in seconds.


## Peaks Over Threshold - Poisson Process (POT-PP) {#pot-pp}

Similar to how the adjustment of statistical data to a normal distribution works in order to make inferences considering deviations from the mean, here only some part of the data (those that are extreme - over a high threshold - POT), need to be fitted to a PP considering extreme deviations from the mean. While in the first case (normal distribution) the inferences are for events similar to the samples, in this case, when working with extreme value theory, the inferences will be for more extreme events than any previously observed or measured. In the [theoretical framework](#rmd-thefra) section are described the main elements of [POT-PP](#pot-pp). 

In summary, POT means only to work with extreme values, and PP means to adjust data to a _pdf_, which depends on an intensity function $\lambda(t,y)$, where $t$ is time, $y$ is wind extreme velocity. As is shown in figure \@ref(fig:plotdomainpp), in a POT-PP approach with domain $D$, all the observations follow a Poisson distribution with mean $\int_D\lambda(t,y)\,dt\,dy$. Main advantage of POT-PP is that it is designed to consider storm and not-storm events independently (for each disjoint sub-domain $D_1$ or $D_2$ inside $D$, the observations in $D_1$ or $D_2$ are independent random variables), but in the end use them both for the inferences,

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{
          pdf = f(t,y|\eta) = \frac{\lambda(t,y)}{\int_D\lambda(t,y)\,dt\,dy}
        }
  (\#eq:pppdf)
\end{equation}


### Declustering {#decluster}

To make the assumptions of PP more justifiable, it  is important to have only one sample per event, the highest one. For instance, if a hypothetical storm started at 11:30 in the morning and ended at 12:30 in the afternoon, and the time series for that event has thirty wind measurements (one each two minutes), it is necessary to leave only the stronger or maximum value, and this process is called declustering (see Figure \@ref(fig:declustering)). POT-PP defines that all the adjacent observations separated by six hours (6) or less in the case of thunderstorm events, and four (4) days or less, in the case of non-thunderstorm events belong to the same cluster.

```{r declustering, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="De-clustering in PP. Two thunderstorm clusters are shown. Separation between adjacent observations inside the clusters are always equal or less than six hours. Distance between the last event in the first cluster and the first event in the second cluster is larger than six hours.

```


### Thresholding {#thresholding}

As the POT model requires to work only with the most extreme values in the time series, it is necessary to select a threshold to filter out small values. Selection of threshold value imply two effects in the model. Bias is high when a low threshold is selected (many exceedances) because the asymptotic support is weak. Opposite situation happens for high thresholds where variance is potentially high, so according to @Davison1990, it is needed to select a threshold value, consistent with model structure.

y=rnorm(15, mean = 0.2, sd = 0.03)
points(x, y, col="black", pch=20, cex = 1)
```

Selection of the thresholds pairs, one for thunderstorm, and one for non-thunderstorm, is based in $W$ transformation described in [threshold selection section](#thresholdselection). W-statistic is done comparing the ordered empirical result of applying $W = -log(1-U)$ to the data, axis $y$ in figure \@ref(fig:wstatistics), with the theoretical quantiles of an exponential variable with uniform distribution between 0 and 1, axis $x$ in same figure. W-statistic is the highest vertical distance between the 45º line and the points in the graphic. The best thresholds pairs returns the minimum value for W-statistics after testing, in an iterative process, with many threshold pairs combinations.

### Exclude no-data periods

PP requires to remove long periods of time when stations were not recording or failing. Proposed time in @Pintar2015 is 180 days, namely, to remove all the gaps from the time series larger than six months.

### Fit Intensity Function

Probability density function _pdf_, and cumulative distribution function _cdf_, of the PP, depend of the intensity function, and are shown in equation \@ref(eq:pppdf), and equation \@ref(eq:ppcdf), respectively.

To facilitate the estimation of the parameters for the PP intensity function, parameter $shape = \zeta_t$ is taken to be zero in equation \@ref(eq:ppintensityfunction), then doing the limit, the resulting intensity function is the same as the the GEV type I or Gumbel distribution,

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{
          \frac{1}{\psi_t}\exp\left\{\frac{-(y-\omega_t)}{\psi_t}\right\}
         }
  (\#eq:ppusedif)
\end{equation}

In this study, the used intensity functions are shown in next equation \@ref(eq:ppspecificintensityfunction).

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{
    \lambda\left(y,t\right)
    \begin{cases}
      \begin{split}
            &\frac{1}{\psi_s}\exp\left(\frac{-(y-\omega_s)}{\psi_s}\right),\;for\;t\;in\;thunderstorm\;period
            \\
            &\frac{1}{\psi_{nt}}\exp\left(\frac{-(y-\omega_{nt})}{\psi_{nt}}\right),\;for\;t\;in\;non\-thunderstorm\;period      
      \end{split}
    \end{cases}
  }
  (\#eq:ppspecificintensityfunction)
\end{equation}

As is shown in \@ref(fig:fitif), the fitting process involve finding the best group of parameters of the intensity function, in such a way that the red curve (_pdf_ of the PP, based in intensity function) be as tight as possible to the shape of the data histogram. As is described in [POT-PP](#pot-pp), optimal parameters to do the fitting process of the intensity function are calculated using *maximum likelihood*.

```


### Hazard Curve - Return Levels - RL

If equation \@ref(eq:pprl), $Y_N$ is solved using estimated parameters of the intensity function, and a hazard curve is constructed as shown in figure \@ref(fig:hc), where axis $x$ represents annual exceedance probability $P_e = \frac{1}{N}$, and axis $y$ represents the RL $Y_N$ for the corresponding N-years return period, then it will be possible to have the extreme return wind velocity level for any given return period going from axis $x$ to axis $y$ through the curve.

#### Two alternatives approaches for RL

There is an equation that allows direct calculations of return levels, and also it is possible to use the quantile function of Gumbel when shape parameter equals to zero, but it is important to emphasize that equation \@ref(eq:pprv), and the use of Gumbel quantile function for RL calculations, is only valid when the analysis of POT-PP includes only one type of event (thunderstorm or non-thunderstorm), and the average estimated duration time of the event in a year is considered to be one (independent of the units in which time is processed), namely, the values for parameters $A_t$ or $A_{nt}$ of equation \@ref(eq:pprl) are equal to one.

Instead of solving equation \@ref(eq:pprl), next equation \@ref(eq:pprv) can be used replacing directly the PP parameters and the N return periods to create the hazard curve and get RL.

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{
Y_N=\frac{\psi}{\zeta}\left[-log\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)\right]^{-\zeta}-\frac{\psi}{\zeta}+\omega
        }
  (\#eq:pprv)
\end{equation} 

As for this research $\zeta = 0$, return levels $Y_N$ can be calculated using the Gumbel quantile function, but using $(1-\frac{1}{N})$ as probability. 

## Spatial Interpolation

Probabilistic (Kriging) and deterministic (IDW, local polynomials) techniques are used to create maps for return levels with same return period. Interpolation with Kriging requires verification of minimum procedures to ensure proper use of the method, for instance, 

* Structural analysis, which includes data normality check, for example, with Kolmogorov Smirnov or Shapiro Wilk goodness of fit tests, and if needed, data transformation to ensure data normality, e.g. using Box-Cox, and in addition, trend analysis to verify the need for trend modeling, in subsequent steps

* Semivariance Analysis: Use of available tools like cloud semivariogram, experimental semivariogram, directional semivariograms to verify isotropy or anisotropy, and different theoretical semivariograms, to ensure the best model of spatial autocorrelation, as a preliminary step to interpolation.

* Kriging Predictions: Use of different types of Kriging predictors, like simple, ordinary, universal, based on the results of the structural analysis.

* Cross Validation: Use of statistics like root mean square, average standard error, mean standardized, and root mean square standardized, that allow to measure the quality of the predictions and the magnitude of the errors.

Possible advantage of deterministic methods, is a better assessment of the local variability of spatial autocorrelation. It can also be considered with IDW or local polynomials a detailed assessment of structural analysis and cross validation. At the end of the spatial interpolation analysis all the predictions can be compared to select the most suitable result.

## Integration with Non-Hurricane data

@Asce2017 propose the equation C26.5-2 for combination of statistically independent events, of non-hurricane and hurricane wind speed data. 

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{
          P_e(y>Y_N) = 1 - P_{NH}(y<Y_N)*P_{H}(y<Y_N)
        }
  (\#eq:combination)
\end{equation} 

Where $P_e(y>Y_N)$ is the annual exceedance probability for the combined wind hazards, $P_{NH}(y<Y_N)$ is the annual non-exceedance probability for non-hurricane winds, and $P_{H}(y<Y_N)$ is the annual non-exceedance probability for hurricane winds.

To understand equation \@ref(eq:combination), it is important to remember that to calculate return level $Y_N$, for a given N-year return period, the exceedance probability $\frac{1}{N}$ of $Y_N$ is calculated. Then, the non-exceedance probability for $Y_N$ is $\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)$. The procedure consist in the creation of a new hazard curve, calculating all $P_e(y>Y_N)$ values for different $Y_N$ return levels, combining hazard curves from non-thunderstorm and thunderstorm data.

Equation \@ref(eq:combination) can be expressed in terms of only exceedance probabilities, $P_{e} = 1 - (1 -P_{nh}) * (1 - P_{h})$, where $P_{nh}$ is the the annual exceedance probability for non-hurricane winds, and $P_{h}$ is the annual exceedance probability for hurricane winds. A graphical explanation of the procedure to calculate the combined $P_e$ for the return level $30\frac{Km}{h}$, is shown in next figure \@ref(fig:combinedhc). For each cell in the study area, it is neccesary to calculate a new combined hazard curve, this is, all the $P_e$ values corresponding all different return levels (see right table in figure \@ref(fig:combinedhc)).

After the combined hazard curve is created, a new process of spatial interpolation need to be accomplished. In case of absence of hazard curves for stations, but availability of return levels maps, it becomes necessary to recreate hazard curves cell by cell, to apply equation \@ref(eq:combination). In this case are required as many maps as possible for different return periods, in order to estimate detailed enough hazard curves from return level values (cell values).
