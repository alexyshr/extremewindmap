Change descriptions of table 
Table B.5: Content of the output Excel Book ’fitted_
model_result.xlsx’ (sheet pp_pintar). One file by dataset
(ISD, ERA5).
(return_levels.csv)


change estaciones by stations (including 01 estaciones.txt)

label of stations text file. mph by kph



return_levels.csv
change descriptions of 10 to 20 including the intensity function and Yn ecuation in NIST report


change code for raw_data_station_id_fitted.csv (I added one column in position 2): Written By

modify the elements of the table repreenting the matriz ZZZ (to be written to fitted_model_result.xlsx)

change name plot_t.r to rl_plot_t.r

Verify:
- At y Ant are in days for time dependency (t and nt)
- At y Ant are 1 when no time dependency (t or nt)
- Columnns t_gamma_Pot-Poisson-GPD and nt_gamma_Pot-Poisson-GPD are there to do calculations with Pot-Poisson-GPD.
- Put how was calculated nt_average_events_per_year (key procedure in declustering - distance between non thunderstorm events considered same cluster)
- Write in manual the trick for Equivalent POT-Poisson-GPD of POT-PP
- Write in manual: For Yn
this ecuation is the solution of the integral in time and magnitude using the 
Poisson Process Intensity Function equation 16 page 39 NIST Report 500-301 (same equation page 28, but not depending of time)


***After contract in Ais
--- Raw data files need to have 'kph' instead of 'mph' (text files were changed)
