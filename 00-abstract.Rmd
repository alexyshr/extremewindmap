For the input non-hurricane, non tornadic data in each available station of the study area (field measurement of forecast models), this research calculate extreme winds or return levels with three different mean recurrence intervals - MRI, 700, 1700, and 3000 years, with a change of being equaled or exceeded only one time in the corresponding MRI period. Then, continuous maps of wind extreme velocities are interpolated to cover the study area, which are mixed with existing wind extreme hurricane studies to be used as input loads for infrastructure design.    \par

Spatio-temporal analysis of historical wind data for infrastructure design, namely, $-$ from wind time series represented in forecast models over rectangular areas or pixels with a virtual station at its center, or field measurements at weather stations in specific coordinates around the study area, $-$ calculate wind extreme magnitudes to be used as design loads of structures of different risk categories (bridges, houses, buildings, hospitals, etc), requires the use of statistical extreme value analysis methodologies to create maps with different mean recurrence intervals (MRI), $-$ short ones for less risky/important structures, and long ones for highly important structures.

Method used to calculate the return levels at each station is the Peaks Over Threshold - POT, using a non-homogeneous, bi-dimensional Poisson Process described, recommended by @Asce2017, and developed and implemented in @Pintar2015. To interpolate maps a geostatistical procedure using Kriging was implemented, considering the model with the best goodness of fit from model parameters comparison.
