For the input non-hurricane, non tornadic data in each available station of the study area, this research calculate extreme winds or return levels for three different mean recurrence intervals - MRI, 700, 1700, and 3000 years, with a change of being equaled or exceeded only one time in the corresponding MRI period. Then, continuous maps of wind extreme velocities are interpolated to cover the study area, which are combined with existing wind extreme hurricane studies, to be used as input loads for infrastructure design.\par

The development of this research focused in non-hurricane data, covers three main areas, _downscaling support_, _temporal analysis_, and _spatial analysis_, and includes in the end an integration process with _existing results of hurricane studies_, which all together, allow to generate  extreme winds maps with different mean recurrence intervals (MRIs), for the design of structures of different risk categories, namely, less risky/important structures for short MRIs (700 and 1700 years), and highly important structures for the longest MRI of 3000 years.

Due to the specific characteristics of the study area, where there is a lack of historical wind measurements (IDEAM data source), it became necessary to look for _alternative data sources_, ISD (model, based on IDEAM), and ERA5 (forecast data), which resulted in the downscaling issue, and that was confronted from a graphic comparison of all sources by matching stations, in the search of adequate support for the use of complementary data. The result of the comparison showed little similarity between the different sources. Prior to the comparison process, ISD and IDEAM data sources were standardized to represent 3-second wind gust, 10 meters anemometer height, and terrain open space roughness.

The method of temporal analysis used to calculate the return levels at each station, from the historical wind time series, is the Peaks Over Threshold - POT, using a non-homogeneous, bi-dimensional Poisson Process - PP, recommended by @Asce2017, and developed and implemented in @Pintar2015, considering from a maximum likelihood adjustment, the model with the best goodness of fit. Main components of this matters are de-clustering, thresholding, intensity function fitting, hazard curve, and return levels calculation.

Non-hurricane maps where created for data sources ISD and ERA5, using Kriging as spatial interpolation method, and after the integration with hurricane studies, the results for ERA5 showed the most reliable final maps, despite limitations in input data. Due to the limitation in the classification of storm and non-storm data, ISD final map showed very very high wind values, which are quite unlikely.
